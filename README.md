# Gmail Automation Workflow

This is an automated email response workflow built using [n8n](https://n8n.io),  designed to classify and respond to incoming Gmail messages using AI.

## üß† Workflow Overview

- Triggers on new **unread emails** via **Gmail Trigger**.

- Personalizes the greeting based on the extracted name.

  - Course Requests
  - Consultation Requests
  - Payments
  - Miscellaneous
- Applies corresponding labels to each email for better organization.
